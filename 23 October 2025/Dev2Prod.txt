Software Environment Lifecycle (Cloud-based)

1. Dev Environment (Development)
	•	Setup: Virtual Machine (VM) in the cloud.
	•	Purpose: For developers to write and build new code.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Code development and initial integration.
	•	Local testing before pushing to the shared environment.
	•	Use of CICD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines to automate builds and deployments.

⸻

2. QA Environment (Quality Assurance)
	•	Setup: Another VM in the cloud.
	•	Purpose: Validate that the application works as expected.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Test the latest build.
	•	File bugs → fix issues → retest until the environment is “GREEN” (stable).
	•	Ensures that the build is ready for staging.

⸻

3. Staging Environment
	•	Setup: Another VM in the cloud.
	•	Purpose: Acts as a mirror of the production environment.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Final round of testing before user acceptance.
	•	Used to verify deployment scripts, environment variables, and configurations.
	•	Helps detect environment-specific issues.

⸻

4. UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
	•	Purpose: End-users or business stakeholders validate functionality.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Load testing and stress testing for performance validation.
	•	Confirm that the system meets business requirements.
	•	Sign-off for release to pre-production.

⸻

5. PPE (Pre-Production Environment)
	•	Setup: Another VM in the cloud.
	•	Purpose: A final testing ground before production.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Conduct last validation with production-like data and configurations.
	•	Final regression testing.
	•	Check deployment automation and rollback strategies.

⸻

6. Production Environment
	•	Purpose: Live environment accessed by end-users.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	GO LIVE — application is fully operational.
	•	Monitor system performance, logs, and errors.
	•	Deploy patches or hotfixes via CICD if necessary.

⚙️ CICD Pipeline Overview
	•	CI (Continuous Integration):
	•	Automates build, test, and integration of code changes.
	•	Helps detect issues early.
	•	CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):
	•	Automates release to testing and production environments.
	•	Ensures consistency and reduces manual deployment errors.
