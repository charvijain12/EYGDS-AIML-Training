WHAT IS RabbitMQ?

It is a message broker,
Software that lets different parts of a system send and receive messages between each other asynchronously,
it receives, stores annd delivers messages between systems or services,
RabbitMQ is written on Erlang(a programming language) which uses OTP to handle concurrency, fault tolerance and clustering featres.
Supports several messaging protocols, commonly used with Advanced Messge Queuing Protocol (AMQP)

WHY USE QUEUES IN A RELATIME SYSTEM?

Queues in RabbitMQ helps to handle communication between Producers(Senders) and Consumers(Receivers) efficiently and reliably.
Features of queues:
1. Decoupling - Sender and receiver can work independently 
2. Load Balancing - Incase of many consumers using the system, it evenly distributes messages between them
3. Reliable/Persistent - Data is stored safely, no data loss incase of service crash also
4. Async Processing - Producers can keep working without waiting for consumers to finish
5. Scalibility - easy to add more consumers
6. Flow Control - queues act like buffers to avoid system overloads

	3.	Online Gaming (e.g., PUBG, Call of Duty)
	•	Handles matchmaking, in-game events, score updates, and notifications for millions of players.
	4.	Banking & FinTech (e.g., Paytm, Stripe, Revolut)
	•	Processes transactions, fraud detection alerts, account updates, and notifications reliably.
	5.	IoT / Smart Devices (e.g., Smart Homes, Wearables)
	•	Collects and processes sensor data, device alerts, and automation tasks asynchronously.
