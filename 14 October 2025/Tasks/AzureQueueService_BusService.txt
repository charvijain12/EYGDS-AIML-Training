Azure Queue Storage vs Azure Service Bus

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Queue Storage:
- A simple message queuing service that is part of Azure Storage.
- Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol for communication.
- Does not guarantee message order (best-effort FIFO).
- No built-in duplicate detection or transactions.
- Message size limit is 64 KB.
- At-least-once delivery guarantee.
- Dead-lettering must be handled manually.
- Simple FIFO mechanism with basic functionality.
- Lower cost and ideal for basic decoupled communication between components.
- Best for background jobs, simple message passing, and lightweight systems.

Azure Service Bus:
- An enterprise-grade messaging system designed for complex communication patterns.
- Uses AMQP protocol (and also supports HTTP).
- Supports FIFO via sessions and message ordering.
- Includes built-in duplicate detection and transaction support.
- Message size limit is 256 KB (Standard tier) or 1 MB (Premium tier).
- Offers at-least-once and exactly-once delivery guarantees.
- Has built-in dead-letter queues for handling undeliverable messages.
- Provides advanced features like topics, subscriptions, message scheduling, and auto-forwarding.
- More expensive but feature-rich and reliable for enterprise use cases.
- Best for distributed systems, financial apps, and pub/sub communication models.

When to use Azure Queue Storage:
- When you need a simple, low-cost, and reliable queue.
- When message order and duplication are not critical.
- Suitable for background processing and lightweight communication between services.

When to use Azure Service Bus:
- When you need advanced messaging features like topics, subscriptions, and transactions.
- When you need guaranteed message ordering or duplicate detection.
- When your system requires dead-lettering or pub/sub patterns.
- Ideal for enterprise applications, microservices, and critical workflows.
