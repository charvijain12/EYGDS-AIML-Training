Task: “Build & Judge a Mini AI”

Part 1 — Chronology of AI

Write one real-world example for each stage:

Machine Learning →
Deep Learning →
Computer Vision →
NLP →
LLMs →

Part 2 — Deep Learning Architectures 

Match the model to the use case:                 Use cases:

1. RNN                                           a. Image recognition
2. LSTM                                          b. Text translation (old Google Translate)
3. CNN                                           c. Predicting the next word in ChatGPT
4. Transformer                                   d. Early speech-to-text systems

Answer : 

Part 3 — Frameworks

Choose one framework (PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras).
In one sentence, explain why you would use it if you were a student making a
cat-vs-dog classifier.


Part 4 — Evaluation Metrics

Imagine you built a spam filter. Answer:
Precision: If it marks 10 emails as spam and 7 are truly spam → what’s
Precision?
Recall: If there were 12 spam emails in total, how many did it catch?
(use same example)
F1 Score: Use the formula and calculate (round to 2 decimals).
MSE/MAE: Predict your friend’s age (actual = 15, prediction = 18). Which
metric punishes the error more?
BLEU/ROUGE: AI translated “The cat sat on the mat” as “Cat is on the
mat.” Which metric (BLEU/ROUGE) do you think would give a high score?

Part 5 — Responsible AI & Explainability
You built an AI that predicts loan approvals.
A customer asks, “Why was my loan rejected?”

Write one simple way to explain the decision fairly (e.g., “Your income was too
low compared to the loan size”).
Deliverable: Each trainee should write answers in 5–7 short lines.
