 1. What is Prompting?

Prompting means giving instructions or examples to an LLM in natural language (or structured text) so that it produces the desired output.
It’s essentially the art of communicating effectively with an LLM.

A prompt can include:
	•	A question or instruction (“Write a poem about the ocean”)
	•	Context or examples (“Translate this text to French”)
	•	Constraints (“Use fewer than 100 words”)

Prompting directly affects model behavior — the better the prompt, the more relevant and accurate the response.

2. Zero-shot Prompting

Definition:
Giving the model a task without any examples — you rely entirely on the model’s pretrained knowledge.

Example:

“Classify the sentiment of this review: The movie was amazing!”

The model must infer that this is a positive sentiment just from its general knowledge.

Use case:
When the model already understands the task type (like summarization, translation, classification, etc.).

3. Few-shot Prompting

Definition:
You show the model a few examples of the task before asking it to perform it.
This helps the model “infer the pattern” or “task format”.

Use case:
Useful when the model isn’t fine-tuned for a task, or when you want to establish a specific tone, style, or format.

🔗 4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Definition:
Encourages the model to reason step-by-step before giving the final answer.
This is especially useful for math, logic, or reasoning tasks.

Example:

“Let’s think step by step:
A train travels 60 km in 1 hour. How long will it take to travel 180 km?”

The model might respond:

“60 km in 1 hour means 60 km/hour.
180 ÷ 60 = 3.
So it will take 3 hours.”

Use case:
When reasoning or multi-step logic is required.

🎛️ 5. Prompt Tuning

Definition:
Instead of manually writing prompts, we train small, learnable prompt vectors (soft prompts) that guide the model’s behavior for a specific task.

Think of it as fine-tuning the prompt, not the model.

Two types:
	1.	Soft Prompt Tuning:
	•	The “prompt” is a small set of continuous embeddings (not human-readable text) learned through gradient descent.
	•	Only the prompt is trained; the main model weights are frozen.
	2.	Prefix Tuning / P-tuning:
	•	Similar idea — a learned prefix is prepended to the model’s inputs to steer behavior.

Example use case:
Instead of retraining a 175B-parameter model, you can train a 10K-parameter soft prompt for each downstream task — efficient and lightweight.
