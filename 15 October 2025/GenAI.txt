WHAT IS GEN AI?

- AI that is generative (Gen AI) 
- The term "generative AI," which stands for "generative artificial intelligence," describes a class of AI systems that are capable of producing original text, images,        audio, video, and even code. 
- Generative AI models learn the patterns, structures, and relationships within data, in contrast to traditional AI models that merely analyze or categorize data. 
- They then utilize this knowledge to produce unique outputs that closely resemble content created by humans.
- These models are often built using deep learning techniques, especially neural networks like 
	transformers, 
	GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), and 
	VAEs (Variational Autoencoders).
- They are trained on massive datasets and can understand context, tone, and style to produce high-quality, contextually relevant outputs.

Types of Generative AI

	1.	Text Generation
		- Creates human-like written content such as essays, articles, chat responses, code documentation, and summaries.
		- Models: GPT (like ChatGPT), Google Gemini, Claude, LLaMA.
		- Use cases: Chatbots, content creation, translation, summarization, email writing, etc.

	2.	Image Generation
		- Produces realistic or artistic images from text descriptions or samples.
		- Models: DALLÂ·E
		- Use cases: Digital art, product design, marketing visuals, game assets, etc.

	3.	Audio Generation
		- Generates sounds, speech, or music.
		- Models: text-to-speech systems.
		- Use cases: Voice assistants, audiobooks, music composition, dubbing, and sound design.

	4.	Code Generation
		- Writes or completes computer code automatically from natural language prompts or partial code.
		- Models: GitHub Copilot, Code Llama, AlphaCode.
		- Use cases: Software development, debugging, learning to code, and automating repetitive programming tasks.
